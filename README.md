Andersen lab - linkage mapping

Report 2 has dependencies on Report 1 - see the instructions in Linkage mapping.Rmd.
R functions are in linkageMappingFunctions.R, the two csv files contain the genetic map.
SNPgenomepositions.csv contains the genomic position data
QTLplotfxns.R contains some source code that was used in linkageMappingFunctions.R, but is not 
really necessary to the generation of the report.
